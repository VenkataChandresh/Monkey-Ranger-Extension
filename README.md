# 🐒 Monkey Ranger Extension

> _"Monkey sees your deadlines. Monkey is not impressed."_

A Chrome extension that fetches your Canvas assignments and roasts you
for procrastinating — because nothing motivates students like being
judged by a monkey.

---

## 🎯 What It Does

- Fetches your Canvas calendar and assignments
- Checks what's submitted and what isn't
- Assigns a **threat level** based on how close your deadline is
- Delivers a **sarcastic monkey roast** based on your situation
- Gets progressively more unhinged the closer you are to doom
