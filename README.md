# 🐒 Monkey Ranger Extension

> "Monkey sees your deadlines. Monkey is not impressed."

Monkey Ranger is a Chrome extension that watches your Canvas assignments, calculates your procrastination threat level, and delivers sarcastic monkey warnings before your academic downfall becomes irreversible.

Built for students who think "I still have time" when they absolutely do not.

---

## 🎯 What It Does

Monkey Ranger acts as your chaotic academic guardian by:

- Monitoring your Canvas assignments (simulated for prototype)
- Detecting submitted vs unsubmitted work
- Delivering sarcastic and progressively unhinged monkey warnings
- Helping students prioritize work before panic mode activates

Monkey Ranger doesn't just show deadlines.

Monkey judges your life choices.

## 🌩️ Threat Levels

| Level      | Time Left | Monkey Response                             |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Chill   | 5+ days   | Monkey is proud. Don't ruin this.           |
| 🟡 Nervous | 2–4 days  | Monkey is watching. Monkey senses weakness. |
| 🟠 Panic   | 1 day     | OOH OOH AH AH. MONKEY PANICKING.            |
| 🔴 Doomed  | <6 hours  | Monkey has seen this before. It ends badly. |
| 💀 RIP     | Overdue   | Monkey attended your academic funeral.      |
